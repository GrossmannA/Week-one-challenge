# <Week One Challenge>

## Week 1 Challenge

A marketing agency requested we update their webpage code to meet accesibility standards.

I reformatted many elements from `<div>` into more descriptive elements ie. `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<aside>`.
I also added in alternative text for anyone that needs a screen reader.
